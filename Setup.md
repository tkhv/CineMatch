# Pre-Requisites

- User must have a compatible laptop or PC that can run the latest version of ReactJS, Express.js and Node.js.

# Dependencies
- To use our web application, the user will need access to ReactJS, Express.js, Node.js, Vercel, and the TMDB API.

# Build Instructions
To build this project, do the following (in order):
1. `cd frontend`

2. `npm install`

# Installation
- Don't forget to follow the instructions above to properly get your .env file inside of the frontend repo.

# Run Instructions
- After the software is built, execute npm start from inside of the frontend directory to start the application.

# Troubleshooting
- A common error is that one tends to incorrectly configure their API key inside of .env.
- Another common error is that one uses the TMDB API key instead of the longer TMDB read access token when setting the environment variables.
